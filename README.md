# An app for EPL fans

Hope you will enjoy this app and I am excited to get your feedback about the app.

# Features of the app

1. View all the EPL soccer teams.
2. You can know more about your favorite team if you are curious and all you have to do is click the "Explore" button.
3. I even added a "Back to menu" button which will allow you to return to the menu with out refreshing the page.(Bottom of the detail page)
4. Finally I tried to make the app quite a bit responsive.

# Tools used to build the app

1. Bootstrap
2. React-router
3. React-icons
4. Prettier extension for clean coding.
